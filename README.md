>人最宝贵的是生命。生命每个人只有一次。人的一生应当这样度过：当回忆往事的时候，他不会因为虚度年华而悔恨，也不因为碌碌无为而羞愧。

Our life in months is about 900, if we draw it out and each month as a cell, it can be a 30x30=900 cells for a 75-year life. If you want to accomplish something before you die,
, anything from visiting a tourism, learning an instrument, making an app, to big things like creating a startup or making a breakthrough in certain fields, whatever, 
try to schedule your time to before it's too late. 


## In terms of implementation
